# Python-Tkinter-UI-Maker
This app allows you to create UI's with **tkinter** very easily.

Just add any widget to your **canvas**, change their properties and see them get updated **live**.

__Once you're done, just let the app write your code:__

You can organise your code in several functions and decide if your widget is a standalone (self.name) variable or inside a widget dictinary. 

Furthermore, all the widget properties are stored in a json file : **the style sheet.**

There may be a lot of bugs within the app. Please raise an issue if you find one so it can be fixed.
