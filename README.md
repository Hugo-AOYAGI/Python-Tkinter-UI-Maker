# Python-Tkinter-UI-Maker
This app allows you to create UI's with **tkinter** very easily.

**This app is not yet complete but it is pretty advanced.**

Just add any widget to your **canvas**, change their properties and see them get updated **live** !

__Once you're done, just let the app write your code:__

You can organise your code in several functions and decide wheter your widget is a standalone variable or inside a widget dictinary. 
Furthermore, all the widget properties are stored in a json file : **the style sheet.**
